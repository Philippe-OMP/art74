@article{donati_spectropolarimetric_1997,
	abstract = {This paper reports the results of five years (five runs, 23 nights) of spectropolarimetric observations of active stars with the UCL Echelle Spectrograph of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. 225 circularly (and four linearly) polarized spectra were recorded on 28 objects (21 active stars and seven calibration standards) using the new technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging. To extract polarization echelle spectra from raw frames, we developed a new dedicated automatic software package (called ESprit, which utilizes optimal extraction techniques) whose detailed description is given in the paper. For each recorded spectrum, we extract `mean' polarized and unpolarized profiles using `least-squares deconvolution', a technique similar to cross-correlation, which can enhance enormously the sensitivity of Zeeman-Doppler imaging, by up to 7.5 mag in flux with respect to a single average line analysis or by 4.5 mag compared with the older technique of Donati et al. in the particular case of a K1 star. Magnetic field is detected unambiguously on 14 objects, namely the weak-line T Tauri star V410 Tau, the pre-main-sequence binary HD 155555, the ZAMS stars AB Dor and LQ Hya, the dwarf flare star CC Eri, the RS CVn systems HR 1099, EI Eri, TY Pyx, CF Tuc, SZ Psc, II Peg, IM Peg and IL Hya, and the FK Com star YY Men. Marginal field detections are also obtained for the weak-line T Tauri star HD 283572 and the Herbig Ae star HD 104237. Except on HR 1099 and II Peg, our results represent the first direct field detections ever reported on these objects, and in particular the first direct field detection on as young a star as V410 Tau. Most of the magnetic signatures we detect on cool stars show several sign reversals throughout the line profile, indicating that the parent field structure is rather complex and must feature (as expected) many small-scale magnetic regions of different polarities. For all stars on which Zeeman detections are recorded with sufficient accuracy (namely LQ Hya, CC Eri, HR 1099, EI Eri, II Peg, IL Hya and YY Men), differential least-squares deconvolution from both the blue and the red parts of the spectral domain indicates that the magnetic regions we detect are mostly 500 to 1000 K cooler than, and sometimes at the same temperature as, but never warmer than the surrounding photosphere. Serendipitous results include the first detection (i) of small-amplitude radial velocity variations (1.3kms{\textasciicircum}-1 peak to peak) of the Herbig Ae star HD 104237 with small enough a period (37.5+/-1 min) that they must be due to stellar pulsations and (ii) of the solar-like secondary component of the RS CVn system IL Hya.},

@article{decin_probing_2006,
	abstract = {Methods. We have developed a non-LTE radiative transfer code, which calculates the velocity structure and gas kinetic temperature of the envelope in a self-consistent way. The resulting structure of the envelope provides the input for the molecular line radiative calculations which are evaluated in the comoving frame. The code allows for the implementation of modulations in the mass-loss rate. This code has been benchmarked against other radiative transfer codes and is shown to perform well and efficiently.
Results. We illustrate the effects of varying mass-loss rates in case of a superwind phase. The model is applied to the well-studied case of VY CMa. We show that both the observed integrated line strengths as the spectral structure present in the observed line profiles, unambiguously demonstrate that this source underwent a phase of high mass loss (∼3.2 × 10−4 M yr−1) some 1000 yr ago. This phase took place for some 100 yr, and was preceded by a low mass-loss phase (∼1 × 10−6 M yr−1) taking some 800 yr. The current mass-loss rate is estimated to be in the order of 8 × 10−5 M yr−1.
Conclusions. In this paper, we demonstrate that both the relative strength of the CO rotational line profiles and the (non)-occurrence of spectral structure in the profile offer strong diagnostics to pinpoint the mass-loss history.},

@article{kravchenko_tomography_2019,
	abstract = {Context. Red supergiants are cool massive stars and are the largest and the most luminous stars in the Universe. They are characterized by irregular or semi-regular photometric variations, the physics of which is not clearly understood. Aims: The paper aims to derive the velocity field in the red supergiant star μ Cep and to relate it to the photometric variability with the help of the tomographic method. Methods: The tomographic method allows one to recover the line-of-sight velocity distribution over the stellar disk and within different optical-depth slices. This method was applied to a series of high-resolution spectra of μ Cep, and these results are compared to those obtained from 3D radiative-hydrodynamics CO5BOLD simulations of red supergiants. Fluctuations in the velocity field are compared with photometric and spectroscopic variations, the latter were derived from the TiO band strength and serve, at least partly, as a proxy of the variations in effective temperature. Results: The tomographic method reveals a phase shift between the velocity and spectroscopic and photometric variations. This phase shift results in a hysteresis loop in the temperature - velocity plane with a timescale of a few hundred days, which is similar to the photometric one. The similarity between the hysteresis loop timescale measured in μ Cep and the timescale of acoustic waves disturbing the convective pattern suggests that such waves play an important role in triggering the hysteresis loops.

Here, we investigate whether a similar linearly polarized spectrum exists for {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used the spectropolarimeter Narval, combining multiple polarimetric sequences to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of individual lines, as well as the least-squares deconvolution (LSD) approach, to investigate the presence of an averaged linearly polarized profile for the photospheric lines. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We have discovered the existence of a linearly polarized spectrum for {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}, detecting a rather strong signal (at a few times 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} of the continuum intensity level), both in individual lines and in the LSD profiles. Studying its properties and the signal observed for the resonant Na I D lines, we conclude that we are mainly observing depolarization of the continuum by the absorption lines. The linear polarization of the Betelgeuse continuum is due to the anisotropy of the radiation field induced by brightness spots at the surface and Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere. We have developed a geometrical model to interpret the observed polarization, from which we infer the presence of two brightness spots and their positions on the surface of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}. We show that applying the model to each velocity bin along the Stokes Q and U profiles allows the derivation of a map of the bright spots. We use the Narval linear polarization observations of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} obtained over a period of 1.4 yr to study the evolution of the spots and of the atmosphere. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our study of the linearly polarized spectrum of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Betelgeuse{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} provides a novel method for studying the evolution of brightness spots at its surface and complements quasi-simultaneous observations obtained with PIONIER at the VLTI.

@article{chiavassa_radiative_2011,
	abstract = {Context. Red supergiants are massive evolved stars that contribute extensively to the chemical enrichment of our Galaxy. It has been shown that convection in those stars produces large granules that cause surface inhomogeneities and shock waves in the photosphere. The understanding of their dynamics is crucial for unveiling the unknown mass-loss mechanism, their chemical composition, and their stellar parameters. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present a new generation of red supergiant simulations with a more sophisticated opacity treatment performed with 3D radiative-hydrodynamics code CO5BOLD. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: In the code the coupled equations of compressible hydrodynamics and non-local radiation transport are solved in the presence of a spherical potential. The stellar core is replaced by a special spherical inner boundary condition, where the gravitational potential is smoothed and the energy production by fusion is mimicked by a simply producing heat corresponding to the stellar luminosity. All outer boundaries are transmitting for matter and light. The post-processing radiative transfer code OPTIM3D is used to extract spectroscopic and interferometric observables. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We show that if one relaxes the assumption of frequency-independent opacities, this leads to a steeper mean thermal gradient in the optical thin region that strongly affects the atomic strengths and the spectral energy distribution. Moreover, the weaker temperature fluctuations reduce the incertitude on the radius determination with interferometry. We show that 1D models of red supergiants must include a turbulent velocity that is calibrated on 3D simulations to obtain the effective surface gravity that mimics the effect of turbulent pressure on the stellar atmosphere. We provide an empirical calibration of the ad hoc micro- and macroturbulence parameters for 1D models using the 3D simulations: we find that there is no clear distinction between the different macroturbulent profiles needed in 1D models to fit 3D synthetic lines.},

@article{mathias_evolution_2018,
	abstract = {Betelgeuse is an M-type supergiant that presents a circularly polarized (Stokes V) signal in its line profiles, interpreted in terms of a surface magnetic field. The weak circular polarization signal has been monitored over 7.5 years in order to follow its evolution on different timescales, and eventually to determine its physical origin. Linear polarization measurements have also been obtained regularly in the last few years. We used both the ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra, which were processed by means of the least-squares deconvolution (LSD) method. In order to ensure the reality of the very weak circular polarization, special care has been taken to limit instrumental effects. In addition, several tests were performed on the Stokes V signal to establish its stellar and Zeeman origin. We confirm the magnetic nature of the circular polarization, pointing to a surface magnetic field of the order of 1G. The Stokes V profiles present variations over different timescales, the most prominent one being close to the long secondary period (LSP; around 2000d for Betelgeuse) often invoked in red evolved stars. This long period is also dominant for all the other Stokes parameters. The circular polarization is tentatively modeled by means of magnetic field concentrations mimicking spots, showing in particular that the velocity associated with each "spot" also follows the long timescale, and that this signal is nearly always slightly redshifted. From the coupled variations of both linear and circular polarization signatures in amplitude, velocity and timescale, we favour giant convection cells as the main engine at the origin of polarization signatures and variations in all the Stokes parameters. This strengthens support for the hypothesis that large convective cells are at the origin of the LSP.},

We also aim to analyse the resulting images over time, to measure the size and dynamics of the convective structures in these stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Rayleigh scattering polarizes the continuum and spectral lines depolarize it. This depolarization is seen as a linear polarization signal parallel to the radial direction on the stellar disk. Integrated over the disk, it would result in a null signal, except if brightness asymmetries/inhomogeneities are present. This is the basic concept behind our imaging technique. Through several tests and comparisons, we have tried to assess and extend its validity, and to determine what can be learnt unambiguously through it. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The several tests and comparisons performed prove that our technique reliably retrieves the salient brightness structures in the photosphere of Betelgeuse, and should be relevant to other red supergiants. For Betelgeuse, we demonstrate that these structures we infer are convective cells, with a characteristic size of more than 60\% of the stellar radius. We also derive the characteristic upflow and downflow speeds, 22 and 10 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, respectively. We find weak magnetic fields concentrated in the downflow lanes in between granules, similar to the quiet sun magnetism. We follow those convective structures in time. Changes happen on timescales of 1 week, but individual structures can be tracked over 4 yr of observations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The measured characteristics of the convection in Betelgeuse confirm the predictions of numerical simulations in both the strong, supersonic upflows and the size of the convective cells. They also concur in the presence of weak magnetic fields that are completely dominated by the convective flows and constrained to the dark lanes of down-flowing plasma.

@article{lopez_ariste_asymmetric_2019,
	abstract = {Aims: We derive information about the dynamics of the stellar photosphere, including pulsation, from a coherent interpretation of the linear polarisation detected in the spectral lines of the Mira star χ Cyg. Methods: From spectropolarimetric observations of
χ Cyg, we performed a careful analysis of the polarisation signals observed in atomic and molecular lines, both in absorption and emission, using radiative transfer in the context of polarisation produced through two mechanisms: intrinsic polarisation and continuum depolarisation. We also explain the observed line doubling phenomenon in terms of an expanding shell in spherical geometry, which allows us to pinpoint the coordinates over the stellar disc with enhanced polarisation. Results: We find that the polarised spectrum of χ Cyg is dominated by intrinsic polarisation and has a negligible continuum depolarisation. The observed polarised signals can only be explained by assuming that this polarisation is locally enhanced by velocity fields. During the pulsation, radial velocities are not homogeneous over the disc. We map these regions of enhanced velocities. Conclusions: We set an algorithm to distinguish the origin of this polarisation in any stellar spectra of linear polarisation and to find a way to increase the signal by coherently adding many lines with an appropriated weight. Applied to the Mira star χ Cyg, we reached the unexpected result that during the pulsation, velocities are radial but not homogeneous over the disc. The reason for these local velocity enhancements are probably related to the interplay between the atmospheric pulsation dynamics and the underlying stellar convection.

@article{kravchenko_tomography_2018,
	abstract = {Context. Cool giant and supergiant star atmospheres are characterized by 
complex velocity fields originating from convection and pulsation
processes which are not fully understood yet. The velocity fields impact
the formation of spectral lines, which thus contain information on the
dynamics of stellar atmospheres. Aim. The tomographic method allows to
recover the distribution of the component of the velocity field
projected on the line of sight at different optical depths in the
stellar atmosphere. The computation of the contribution function to the
line depression aims at correctly identifying the depth of formation of
spectral lines in order to construct numerical masks probing spectral
lines forming at different optical depths. Methods: The
tomographic method is applied to one-dimensional (1D) model atmospheres
and to a realistic three-dimensional (3D) radiative hydrodynamics
simulation performed with CO5BOLD in order to compare their spectral
line formation depths and velocity fields. Results: In 1D model
atmospheres, each spectral line forms in a restricted range of optical
depths. On the other hand, in 3D simulations, the line formation depths
are spread in the atmosphere mainly because of temperature and density
inhomogeneities. Comparison of cross-correlation function profiles
obtained from 3D synthetic spectra with velocities from the 3D
simulation shows that the tomographic method correctly recovers the
distribution of the velocity component projected on the line of sight in
the atmosphere.},

@article{gray_mass_2008,
	abstract = {Spectroscopic observations of Betelgeuse, taken at the Elginfield Observatory, show velocity and temperature variations delineating the systematic, but generally chaotic, rise and fall of photospheric material. The characteristic timescale of the variations is 400 days, while velocities cover a range of {\textasciitilde}9 km s-1. Macroturbulence is constant to about 13\% and does not result from motions on the largest scales, but from motions within the large structures. The line bisectors have predominantly a reversed-C shape. Variations in the shapes of bisectors occur on the 1 km s-1 level and are not obviously connected to their shifts in wavelength. A likely explanation of the observations is granulation and giant convection cells accompanied by short-lived oscillations they trigger. Random convection events may account for radial-velocity jitter seen in many highly evolved stars.},

	abstract = {Understanding convection in red supergiants and the mechanisms that trigger the mass loss from these evolved stars are the general goals of most observations of Betelgeuse and its inner circumstellar environment. Linear spectropolarimetry of the atomic lines of the spectrum of Betelgeuse reveals information about the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of brightness in its atmosphere. We model the distribution of plasma and its velocities and use inversion algorithms to fit the observed linear polarization. We obtain the first 3D images of the photosphere of Betelgeuse. Within the limits of the used approximations, we recover vertical convective flows and measure the velocity of the rising plasma at different heights in the photosphere. In several cases, we find this velocity to be constant with height, indicating the presence of forces other than gravity acting on the plasma and counteracting it. In some cases, these forces are sufficient to maintain plasma rising at 60{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}kms to heights where this velocity is comparable to the escape velocity. Forces are present in the photosphere of Betelgeuse that allow plasma to reach velocities close to the escape velocity. These mechanisms may suffice to trigger mass loss and sustain the observed large stellar winds of these evolved stars.},

@article{lopez_ariste_height_2023,
	abstract = {Aims: We seek to understand convection in red supergiants and the mechanisms that trigger the mass loss from cool evolved stars. Methods: Linear spectropolarimetry of the atomic lines of the spectrum of μ Cep reveals information well outside the wavelength range expected from previous models. This is interpreted as structures in expansion that are visible in the front hemisphere and sometimes also in the back hemisphere. We model the plasma distribution together with its associated velocities through an inversion algorithm to fit the observed linear polarization. Results: We find that supposing the existence of plasma beyond the limb rising high enough to be visible above it can explain the observed linear polarization signatures as well as their evolution in time. From this we are able to infer the geometric heights of the convective plumes and establish that this hot plasma rises to at least 1.1 R*. Conclusions: μ Cep appears to be in an active phase in which plasma rises often above 1.1 R*. We generalize this result to all red supergiants in a similarly evolved stage, which at certain epochs may easily send plasma to greater heights, as μ Cep appears to be doing at present. Plasma rising to such heights can easily escape the stellar gravity.},
